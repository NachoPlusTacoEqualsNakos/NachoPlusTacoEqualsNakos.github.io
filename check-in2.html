        <figcaption>Who's the GOAT?</figcaption>

        <p>
            As incredible as <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html">LeBron James</a> is, both as a player and as a figure in sports,
            in my humble opinion, he is second best, with <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jordami01.html">Michael Jordan</a> is still firmly 
            in possession of first place. So who is the best in basketball? I say it's MJ. Let's break down the stats behind this storied argument.
        </p>
        <h2>The Numbers</h2>
        <p>
            Starting with the broadest possible strokes, the numbers favor Michael Jordan more
            than LeBron James:
            <ul>
                <li>MJ has 6 championship rings while LeBron has 4</li>
                <li>MJ has more MVPs (5) and DPOY (1) awards than Bron (4 and 0 respectively)</li>
                <li>MJ is undefeated in the Finals, whereas LeBron's record is 4-6</li>
            </ul>
            <p>and in more detail</p>
            <h2>Championships: Jordan</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>1991: Bulls [61-21] defeat Lakers led by Magic Johnson</li>
                <li>1992: Bulls [67-15] defeat Trailblazers led by Clyde "The Glide" Drexler</li>
                <li>1993: Bulls [59-23] defeat Suns led by Charles Barkley and Dan Majerle</li>
                <li>1996: Bulls [72-10!] defeat Supersonics led by Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp</li>
                <li>1997: Bulls [69-13] defeat Jazz led by John Stockton, Karl Malone, and coach Jerry Sloane</li>
                <li>1998: Bulls [62-20] defeat Jazz for the second year in a row </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Championships/Finals Appearances: LeBron</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>2007: LeBron's god-awful Cavs team somehow makes it to the Finals against the Tim Duncan/Manu/Tony Parker Spurs, and gets swept</li>
                <li>2011: The Big 3 Miami Heat faces Dirk's Mavs in one of the greatest modern NBA finals series</li>
                <li>2012: The Heatles crush the KD-Harden-Westbrook OKC Thunder</li>
                <li>2013: Miami defeats Spurs in 7 games [really 6 because Ray Allen won it for the heat at the end of game 6]</li>
                <li>2014: In another of the greatest finals series ever, the Spurs absolutely annihilate the Heat</li>
                <li>2015: LeBron vs Steph round 1. Warriors win</li>
                <li>2016: LeBron and the Cavs rob GSW of the best season of all time [plus bring Cleveland its first chip]</li>
                <li>2017: LeBron vs Steph round 3. Steph leads 2-1</li>
                <li>2018: LeBron vs Steph round 4. Steph leads 3-1</li>
                <li>2020: Lakers LeBron pandemic ring</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As we can see, Michael Jordan's record at the championship level is damn near flawless. LeBron's is good, too, but 
                the case for LBJ being the greatest of all time is made harder for me to agree with by having a net-minus record in the NBA finals
