<p>
This man is Alex Skolnick. He plays lead guitar in the metal band Testament. He's my favorite guitarist ever and he plays in my favorite
band ever. Alex is one of my biggest inspirations, and I've actually had the pleasure of meeting him after a show and taking a few lessons 
from him. On top of being a phenomenal musician, he's a really nice, well-spoken, down-to-earth guy as well.
