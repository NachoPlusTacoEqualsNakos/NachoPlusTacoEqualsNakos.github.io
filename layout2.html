        <h1>BODIES OF WORK</h1>
        <p>Over the course of my college career, I have carved out a niche for myself
            in three distinct areas: Classical Antiquity, web design, and heavy metal music.
            Here you will find a collection of what I consider the most representative samples
            of my work from each of these areas.

                <h2>Thesis Proposal</h2>
                <p>
                    My main project for my upcoming Senior year will be an interdepartmental Thesis
                    for my major. My thesis will discuss the rise to power and reign of the Roman Emperor
                    Hadrian. Hadrian reigned during the early 2nd Century AD. Hadrian was one of the
                    so-called "Five Good Emperors," whose reigns are generally considered to define
                    the apex of Imperial Rome. </p>

                <h2>Hunter-Master</h2>
                <p>
                    The first song from my band's upcoming debut EP is called Hunter-Master. I consider
                    writing the lyrics (and music) for this song one of my proudest extracurricular achievements
                    in college because this song came about entirely by accident. From there, one idea led to
                    another, and Hunter-Master has quickly become one of our favorite songs to play. Available 
                    to stream on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nPMWzkucis">May 5, 2025!</a></p>

            <h2>Blast Off</h2>
            <p>
                As far as passion projects during college, Blast Off carries even more meaning for me than Hunter-Master.
                Not only was Blast Off the very first Defcon: Dead song ever released (it came out on June 28, 2024), but 
                what this song actually tells a story from my family history, as opposed to fiction. The lyrics to Blast Off
                tell the story of my grandfather's escape from his Nazi captors in 1944 in occupied Greece. My father told
                me the story in middle school, and for years, keeping the story alive in song form had been a passion project...
                and it finally came to fruition in the summer of 2024!

                <h2>CESL Website</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the beginning of my sophomore year, I have worked with UMass' marcom team as a content
                    entry intern. As I became more and more proficient with Drupal, I was eventually assigned a campus
                    website to migrate entirely on my own, as opposed to doing it as a member of a team.

                <h2>Museum Writing Essay</h2>
                <p>
                    My first portfolio item is an essay I wrote for my Junior Year Writing course last semester. The 
                    prompt for this essay involved creating a story centered around an ancient Greco-Roman artifact 
                    each of us was assigned based on what our respective objects allowed us to observe and infer. 
                    I was given an ornate funeral shroud from Roman North Africa to write about, and my essay took 
                    the format of a eulogy in honor of the person whom the shroud was covering as they were being 
                    laid to rest.
