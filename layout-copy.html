            <h1>Hey There, Friends!</h1>

            <p> My name is Nakos Maroudas (pronounced NAH-ko Muh-ROO-das). I am a Junior at UMass Amherst, where I am
                currently studying Classics. In addition to my Bachelor's studies - which primarily concerns the
                languages, history, and literature of the Ancient Greco-Roman world - I am an aspiring web developer,
                as well as an up-and-coming heavy metal musician. 
            </p>
            
            <p> Outside of school, I play lead guitar in a thrash metal which I founded with some UMass friends. We are
                called <a href="https://defcondead.bandcamp.com/">Defcon: Dead</a>. Thrash metal is my favorite music in 
                the world, and my ambition with Defcon: Dead is for it to ultimately be what I do for a living.
            </p>

            <p> But, of course, to quote the immortal AC/DC lyrics: "it's a long way to the top if you wanna rock 'n' roll." 
                Knowing this, I made the decision coming into college to not only work towards my degree, but to use my time 
                as an undergrad to hone other skillsets outside of music that can allow me to support myself in my ultimate
                pursuit of professional heavy metal music. Here you will see a collection of the work I've done as an undergrad
                in the areas of Classics, Web Design, and Music (as well as a few bonus items that hopefully make you smile, and
                brighten your day)
            </p>

            <p> Lastly, here are a handful of pictures from my time so far at UMass that I would say summarize the various 
                facets of who I am
