    <h1>Interests and Hobbies</h1>
        <p>
            My main academic interest is Classical Studies, which for those who
            don't know is the study of the Ancient Mediterranean world (primarily 
            Ancient Greece and Rome). At UMass Amherst, this discipline is divided
            into four track. The track I'm on is the Ancient Languages track, meaning
            that the majority of my coursework entails reading and translating Ancient
            texts in their original languages. Ever since I was in middle school, I've
            had a strong passion for languages (Latin in particular), and my studies at
            UMass have only made that passion stronger
        </p>
        <p>
           In my free time, I enjoy lots of different activities. I love creative writing (song- 
           writing and poetry especially), watching basketball games, hitting the gym with friends,
           playing guitar (more on that below), watching movies, and doing voice impressions. Particularly
           during spooky season and the winter, one of my go-to pastimes is watching old horror movies from
           as far back as the 1930s.

    <h1>Extracurricular Pursuits</h1>
        <p>
            In addition to Classics, my other major passion in life is music. I like many different
            kinds of music, but my absolute favorite genre is heavy metal. My favorite metal band of all time 
            is Testament, and I also really like Sabaton, Exodus, and The Black Dahlia Murder 
            (among many, many others!) 
        <p>
            In fact, I play guitar in a metal band of my own! In November of 2023, I founded a thrash metal band
            called Defcon: Dead. I put the band together along with some friends of mine from UMass.
            We've played a handful of shows so far, and are currently working on our debut EP, which will be available
            on all streaming platforms by mid-spring or so!

    <h1>Skills and Proficiencies</h1>
        <p>
            Over the course of almost a decade of learning, I have gained varying degrees of fluency
            in several foreign languages such as Latin, Modern Greek, and Swedish. After taking to Latin
            fairly quickly in middle and high school, I really capitalized on my interest in language once 
            I arrived at college.
