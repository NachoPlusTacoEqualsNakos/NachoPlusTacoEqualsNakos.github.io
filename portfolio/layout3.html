        <p>
            Heavy metal music has been a major part of my life for about 10 years. From the moment I 
            discovered this loud, roaring, chaotic genre of music, I was immediately hooked for life. 
            Believe it or not, my discovery was completely accidental. To make a long story short, during
            the summer of 2015, I was at summer camp and I randomly stumbled upon Iron Maiden's The Trooper.
            It was an artsy kind of summer camp in my hometown of Amherst, MA, and the counselors had put us 
            in groups to make home movies. Being cursorily familiar with how distorted guitars sounded and what 
            "heavy metal" was, I thought that style of music would fit the scene...and the rest is history!
        </p>
        <p>
            In the coming years, I discovered more songs by Iron Maiden and Metallica. I worshiped Metallica as a middle schooler,
            and James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett were my heroes. But the most pivotal discovery came in 2018 when I stumbled upon 
            "Disciples of the Watch" by Testament. They were the meanest, heaviest band I'd ever heard up to that point. And then 
            Alex Skolnick started soloing...my mind was blown. From that day onward, I dedicated myself to playing guitar. I began 
            playing guitar for sometimes up to 5 or 6 hours a day. Flash forward to May 2022: Testament came to Boston, and I 
            got to meet my idol Alex Skolnick.

            As the throes of the pandemic started to take over, and as going about life from home became
            the norm, my obsession with music grew exponentially. In April 2020, I started taking
            lessons with a professional metal guitarist from Greece named Gus Drax. Though a fairly obscure name
            here in America, he's well-known in the European metal scene. I would be his student until February 2023.
            After a break from lessons for the majority of 2023, I would resume lessons with two new teachers:
            Reece Scruggs of Havok and Machine Head, and Ryan Knight of The Black Dahlia Murder.

            As 2023 turned into 2024, with my desire to achieve my childhood goals reignited and more alive than ever
            before, I would form Defcon: Dead with my friends. I'd tried and failed to get the band off the ground several
            times before, but finally, I had a band of my own. Flash forward to the present day, and my bandmates and I 
            (the Defcon: Dudes, if you will) are hard at work writing songs and playing shows! We will be releasing our debut EP
            called "The Facade Shatters" on May 23 of this year!
