        <h1>WHO I AM AND WHAT I DO</h1>

        <h2>Nakos the Metal Guitarist</h2>

        <p>
            Heavy metal music has been a major part of my life for about 10 years. From the moment I 
            discovered this loud, roaring, chaotic genre of music, I was immediately hooked for life. 
            Believe it or not, my discovery was completely accidental. To make a long story short, during
            the summer of 2015, I was at summer camp and I randomly stumbled upon Iron Maiden's The Trooper.
            It was an artsy kind of summer camp in my hometown of Amherst, MA, and the counselors had put us 
            in groups to make home movies. Being cursorily familiar with what "heavy metal" was through 
            Rodrick in Diary of a Wimpy Kid, I thought a metal song would fit the scene...and the rest is history!
        </p>
        <p>
            In the coming years, my musical diet consisted of several Iron Maiden and Megadeth songs, and Metallica's
            first five records on repeat. James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett were my heroes. But the most pivotal discovery
            came in 2018. In 8th grade art class, I stumbled upon "Disciples of the Watch" by Testament. They were the meanest,
            heaviest band I'd ever heard up to that point, and then Alex Skolnick started soloing...my mind was blown. From that
            day onward, I dedicated myself to playing guitar. Video games fell to the wayside, and I began playing guitar for sometimes
            up to 5 or 6 hours a day. 
        </p>

        <p>Flash forward to May 2022: Testament came to Boston, and I got to meet my idol Alex Skolnick</p>

        <p>
            As the throes of the pandemic started to take over, and as going about life from home became
            the norm, my obsession with music grew exponentially. In April 2020, I started taking
            lessons with a professional metal guitarist from Greece named Gus Drax. Though a fairly obscure name
            here in America, he's well-known in the European metal scene. I would be his student until February 2023.
            For the majority of 2023, I would take a break from guitar lessons until October of that year. Within two
            weeks, I would begin learning from two of my heroes: Reece Scruggs of Havok and Machine Head, and Ryan Knight
            of The Black Dahlia Murder fame. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As 2023 turned into 2024, with my desire to achieve my childhood goals reignited and more alive than ever
            before, I would form Defcon: Dead with my friends. I'd tried and failed to get the band off the ground several
            times before, but finally, I had a band of my own. Flash forward to the present day, and my bandmates and I 
            (the Defcon: Dudes, if you will) are hard at work writing songs and playing shows!
