            <h2>Portfolio Item 1</h2>
            <p>
            My first portfolio item is an essay I wrote for my Junior Year Writing course last semester. The prompt for this essay
            involved creating a story centered around an ancient Greco-Roman artifact each of us was assigned based on what our respective
            objects allowed us to observe and infer. I was given an ornate funeral shroud from Roman North Africa to write about, and my essay
            took the format of a eulogy in honor of the person whom the shroud was covering as they were being laid to rest.

        <h2>Portfolio Item 2</h2>
            <p>
            This next item is another essay from the aforementioned Junior Year Writing class. Linked below is the final project for that course,
            which was an essay centered around the idea of reception. In the field of Classics, reception has to do with how modern audiences interpret
            themes and events from antiquity. My essay takes an in-depth look at how the metal band Nile (whose whole schtick is writing songs about the Ancient World,
            especially Ancient Egypt) used both Hellenistic and Quranic depictions of Alexander the Great for the lyrics of their song "Iskander D'hul Karnon"

        <h2>Portfolio Item 3</h2>
            <p>
            In this third writing sample, I explored some of the philosophy of the Ancient World. The two previous works centered more around Ancient history, but in this sample
            I examined the stances of Plato and Socrates on Athenian democracy. The semester was spent reading Plato's "Apology" (also known as The Trial of Socrates), as well as other
            Platonic dialogues such as the Phaedo. The final paper I wrote for a Greek 400 class I took this past fall.

        <h2>Portfolio Item 4</h2>
            <p>
              Lastly, I wanted to showcase some of the lyrics I've written for my band! Unlike the previous three pieces, I wrote these lyrics in my free time as opposed to for a class.
              These are the lyrics for my band's song "Blast Off." This was the first original we came up with, and it tells a true story from my family. Very long story short, these lyrics
              tell the story of how my grandfather (who fought for Greece in WWII) was taken captive by the Wehrmacht and survived.
